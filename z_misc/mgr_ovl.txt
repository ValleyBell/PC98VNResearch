Mischief OVL format
-------------------
The format is used in "Merry Go Round".
Note: in MGR, OVL files are LZSS-compressed.

"Visitte" (another game by Mischief) uses OVL files as well, but those have a different structure.
Its text strings use the same control codes and script commands are probably similar, except with embedded file names.


Values are stored in Little Endian.

File layout
-----------
? bytes - Game title (null-terminated string)
	Note: This seems to be ignored by the game engine. It is usually "MGR" + 00h.
2 bytes - text data size (ts)
ts bytes - text data
2 bytes - script data size (ss)
ss bytes - script data

Text data
---------
The text data consists of a series of null-terminated strings in Shift-JIS encoding.
Control codes are implemented using "backslash + letter" codes.

Known control codes:
	\cN. - set text colour? (many scripts begin with "\c0.", the dot seems to mark the end of the number)
	\r - line break
	\p - paragraph end (makes the game wait for the user to press a key)

When the first byte in a string is less than 5Ch (TODO: verify the value), this introduces "selection" entries in the following format:
2 bytes - number of entries to follow (n)
n bytes - entries
	1 byte - entry ID (usually 0 .. n-1 or 0FFh)
	? bytes - entry text (null-terminated string)

Script data
-----------
mostly unknown

- 88 49 xx yy = play music where (yyxx = 268h + (musicID-1)*6)
	yyxx is actually an offset to the file title from the "main file list". (see MGR.PTR)
	88 49 68 02 = play music M01 (opening)
	88 49 C8 02 = play music M17 (ending)

There are no file names stored there. Those are kept inside MGR.PTR instead.


MGR.PTR
-------
2 bytes - main file list size (ms)
ms bytes - main file list entries
2 bytes - BGM list size (bs)
bs bytes - BGM list entries

File list entry:
1 byte - file type
	'O' - OVL
	'P' - PCM
	'M' - music file (OPL/MSF)
	'A' - ANM
	'G' - GTR
? bytes - null-terminated file title (without extension)
1 byte - disk ID? (00 = DISK1.LIB, 01 = DISK2.LIB, etc.)

BGM list entry:
? bytes - null-terminated file title (without extension)
1 byte - "valid" flag? (0 = invalid, 1 = valid)
