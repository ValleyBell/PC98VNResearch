Note: All multi-byte values are stored in Little Endian byte order.

Data files with header (BGM, GPP, LOB, P0#, VDP)
----------
Files with the extentions BGM, GPP, LOB, P0# and VDP have follow the following structure:

Pos	Len	Description
00	04	file signature (null-terminated string, varies by file type, e.g. "BGM", "GRP", "LOB", "VDT", "N00", "N01")
04	04	total file size when decompressed (includes the 10h-byte file header)
08	08	?? (format-specific header data)
10	??	file data (compressed or uncompressed, depending on file type)

The LZSS compression uses a nametable initialized with all 00s.
The control byte stores bits from low to high. (same as LZSS.C reference implementation)
The reference word is formatted slightly differently than usual:
    Bytes 12 34 form "offset 0x412, length 0x03"
    i.e. the "length" is stored in the high nibble of the 2nd byte. (LZSS.C has it in the low nibble of the 2nd byte)

For "lzss-tool", the parameters are:
    nametable initialization: -n 0x00
    reference word: -R 0x00
    archive header: -a "sGRP,b00,o4,i00,i00,i00,i00,i00,i00,i00,i00"

The following file formats are known:
file ext.   signature   compression     description
  .BGM        "BGM"       none          music
  .GPP        "GRP"       LZSS          graphics data
  .LOB        "LOB"       none          disk file index
  .VDP        "VDT"       LZSS          some script? (often accompanied by MSG files)
  .P00        "N00"       LZSS          cutscene script
  .P01        "N01"       LZSS          cutscene script

MSG files
---------
These files contain raw text without any header.
Bytes 0Dh 0Ah are used as line endings.
Byte 1Ah marks the end of the file.

FPP files
---------
These are archives that contain multiple GPP files.
They start with a 2-byte file count (n), followed by n 4-byte values specifying the absolute starting offset of each archived file.
The stored GPP files use the same format as when they are stored as separate files.

BEL files
---------
These are archives. (for sound effects?)
They start with a 2-byte file count (n), followed by n 2-byte values specifying the absolute starting offset of each archived file.

LOP files
---------
These are archives that contain multiple SCN files.
They start with a 2-byte file count (n), followed by n 4-byte values specifying the absolute starting offset of each archived file.
