# PC-98 Visual Novel/ADV engine research

I'm collecting all sorts of research done on PC-98 adventure games in this repository.
This includes:

- information about file formats
- tools for unpacking and decoding (and possibly re-packing and encoding)
- disassemblies (IDA Pro format, rendered ASM)

In the long run, this information may help with the translation of some of these games.

## Engine list

| Engine name | Developer | folder |

A list of various games and their known engine versions can be found in [game-list.md](game-list.md).
