# PC-98 Visual Novel/ADV engine research

I'm collecting all sorts of research done on PC-98 adventure games in this repository.
This includes:

- information about file formats
- tools for unpacking and decoding (and possibly re-packing and encoding)
- disassemblies (IDA Pro format, rendered ASM)

In the long run, this information may help with the translation of some of these games.
