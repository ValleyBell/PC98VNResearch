Commands
--------
00 - print dungeon talk
	? bytes - Shift-JIS string, terminated with two backslashes (5C5Ch)
	Special handling:
	- "##" (hex code 2323h) will be replaced with the character name
	- The closing bracket (Shift-JIS code 817Ah) enforces a new line after being printed.
	This is used to show character talk during dungeon crawling.
	It writes to the text box in the lower middle of the screen.
	Automatic line breaks happen after 16 full-width characters.
01 - load music
	? bytes - null-terminated file name
	The file should have a ".M" file extension.
	In MIDI mode, the ".M" is replaced with ".N" to generate the file name of the MIDI song.
	This only loads music data into the sound driver. It does not start playback.
02 - print full-screen talk
	? bytes - Shift-JIS string, see command 00 for details
	This is used to show character talk during full-screen cutscenes.
	It writes to the text box in the lower part of the screen.
	Automatic line breaks happen after 37 full-width characters.
03 - load next scenario
	This command is usually placed after command 1C and will terminate the script execution.
	The game returns to the main loop, which will load a new script file from the file name set by command 1C and execute it.

1C - set next script
	? bytes - null-terminated file name of a script file
	The script will NOT be loaded by the command.

	This calculates an index: [register 1] + [register 2] * 0x10

25 - test bit in register and jump conditionally
	2 bytes - register ID
	2 bytes - bit to be tested
	The command takes the contents of the register, extracts the respective bit (see commands 10/11).
	If the result is 0, it skips 3 additional bytes.

	This command is used to patch the drive letter of a file name in a following command.
	In order to do that, the command starts a search for a colon (:) at the position after the command.
	When a colon is found, it sets the byte preceeding it to the "default disk letter" (from DOS call via INT 21h).
	The search ends early when a 00h byte is found.

Screen draw address
-------------------
Various graphics commands (including most text commands) have an "address" parameter (2 bytes) that specifies an address in screen space.
It can be converted to an X,Y position using the following formulae:
	X = (address % 80) * 8
	Y = (address / 80)
	address = (Y * 80) + (X / 8)
This makes all values from 0x0000 to 0x7CFF valid.

In case of text commands the "draw address" specifies coordinate of the upper left edge of the text to be drawn.

Text strings
------------
- The game has 2 types of text strings: Strings with 1 byte per character and strings with 2 bytes per character.
  Each of those string types is accessed using separate commands.
- 1-byte-character strings can contain ASCII.
  They end with a backspace character (code 5Ch).
  Bytes 00h..7Fh will show ASCII characters from font ROM page 09h. The "HP" and "MP" texts used in battle screens use these.
  Bytes 80h..0FFh will draw half-width Katakana from font ROM page 0Ah. The game uses this for some names.
- 2-byte-character strings use Shift-JIS encoding. All of them are assumed to be full-width. (16 pixels wide)
  They end with a double-backspace character (code 5C5Ch).
  Some of the character codes are remapped to the game's custom font. These are:
  Shift-JIS 8560..8579 (JIS 2941..295A) - These are usually mirrors of the uppercase ASCII letters.
	The game uses them for the characters of the ancient language.
  Shift-JIS 8740..8753 (JIS 2D21..2D34) - These are usually circled numbers 1..20.
	8740..874C - symbols for types of time (dungeon screen, 3rd status line)
	874D..874E - circled 14 and 15 (probably unused)
	874F - diagonal "BS"
	8750 - diagonal "END" (shop/inventory symbol)
	8751..8753 - boxed "\", "+" and "-" (page change symbols in shop/inventory)
  Shift-JIS 8785..8789 (JIS 2D65..2D69) - These are usually circled ideographs.
	8785 - heart
	8786 - sweat droplet
	8787 - sweat drops
	8788 - "RI" (first part of the "RING" currency)
	8789 - "NG" (second part of the "RING" currency)
