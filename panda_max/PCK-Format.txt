PCK Archive Format
==================

NOTE: Before parsing the file, the file header must be descrambled.
The scrambling includes the file signature.

for the first 0x4000 bytes, do:
1. read 2 bytes as a 16-bit Little Endian word
2. rotate the word left by 1 bit
    decoded = ((encoded & 0x7FFF) << 1) | (encoded & 0x8000) >> 15)

PCK File header (after decoding)
---------------
Pos	Len	Description
00	10	"PCK Version 1.00"
10	02	value 0
12	0D	all spaces (20h)
1F	01	Carriage Return byte (0Dh)
20	3FE0	file entries x511 (20h bytes each)

PCK File entry
--------------
Pos	Len	Description
00	0C	file name, null-terminated string, padded with spaces
0C	04	always 0
10	04	data start offset (absolute)
14	04	data length
18	01	time stamp: year (relative to 1980)
19	01	time stamp: month (1..12)
1A	01	time stamp: day (1..31)
1B	01	time stamp: hour
1C	01	time stamp: minute
1D	01	time stamp: second
1E	02	time stamp: unused


Files may be LZSS-compressed. The EXDD.COM driver detects this by checking the file header for "MAXPACK"+00h.

Maxpack File Header
-------------------
00	08	"MAXPACK" 00h
08	02	decompression buffer size
0A	04	size of compressed data (scd)
0E	04	size of decompressed data (usually the same as decompression buffer size)
12	scd	compressed data
